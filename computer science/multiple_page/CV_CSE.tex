\begin{rSubsection}{Path Integral formulation for all particle dynamics}{June 2018 - August 2019}{Summer Research Intern}{}
\item Proposed a new derivation for path integrals of collapse models and other all particle dynamics theories which resulted into a paper "path integrals, spontaneous localization and classical limit". \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04178}.

%	WORK EXPERIENCE SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Siemens Technology \& Services Pvt. Ltd.}{June 2019 - August 2019}{Software Research Intern}{}
\item Used program analysis tools like Atlas to run control flow analysis on large code base which can further be used for extracting knowledge graphs.
\item Implemented four different types (Tensor Product Composition, HOLE, ComplEx, QuatE) of Knowledge Graph embedding probabilistic architectures in PyTorch.
\item Learned about Non-Euclidean real (for symmetric relations) and complex (for asymmetric relations) background geometries for embedding in order to learn effective hierarchical patterns from the Knowledge Graph.
\item Proposed a model for learnable background geometry (components of metric tensor itself are learnable parameters) along with embedding (entity and relations) which can further be useful in manifold learning and other embedding visualization techniques. 
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------
\newpage

\begin{rSubsection}{Siemens Technology \& Services Pvt. Ltd.}{December 2018 - February 2019}{Software Research Intern}{}
\item Processing internal service logs for building shift-right testing application.
\item Used recurrent neural networks (LSTM) to predict most probable test cases which user can execute.
\item Analyse the data for anomaly detection in the logs sequence dataset by probability estimation method.
\item Also tested static probabilistic methods like PAM algorithm to achieve the above task. 
\item Documented the relevant code base and procedures.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------
\begin{rSubsection}{Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai}{June 2018 - July 2018}{Summer Research Intern}{}
\item Proposed a new derivation for path integrals of collapse models and other all particle dynamics theories.
\item Argued that $h$ tends to zero is not the limit to classical mechanics but rather some more robust mechanism to kill macroscopic superpositions.
\item Explained that the above mechanism can be achieved through appropriate limit on collapse model parameters and formalised these limits mathematically.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSection}{Open Source Projects}

\begin{rSubsection}{PyGlow - Information Theory of Deep Learning}{June 2019 - Present}{Author and Maintainer}{}
\item Author and maintainer of a python library for Information Theory in Deep Learning named 'PyGlow' which is currently on its 0.0.6 version on Test PyPI and can be installed from \url{https://test.pypi.org/project/PyGlow}.
\end{rSubsection}
\begin{rSubsection}{EinsteinPy - Numerical Relativity in Python}{February 2018 - Present}{Coauthor}{}
\item Coauthor of a python library for numerical relativity and relativistic astrophysics related computations 'EinsteinPy' - \url{https://einsteinpy.org/team/}
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSection}{Technical Projects}

\begin{rSubsection}{Why Neural Networks work ?}{Major Technical Project}{}{}
\item This is an Ongoing final year major technical project in the field of "Mathematics of Deep Learning".
\item Project aims at developing new theoretical ideas which can provide mathematically formal answers to some of the profound questions in the field of deep learning.
\item These questions include the mechanism of generalization, optimal architectures, phase transitions between memorization and compression phase etc.
\item The project demands the need for exploring cross field topics from information theory, statistical physics, group theory and complexity theory and experiment with these ideas in code.
\item As a result of this project, all the experimentation code is available in form of a Python library package \textbf{PyGlow} which can be installed from PyPI with command "pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ PyGlow".
\item This library is also one of the attempts to develop keras like API in PyTorch backend.
\end{rSubsection}
\newpage
\begin{rSubsection}{Himachal Firespot Datapackage}{}{}{}
\item Forest Fire Notification App under Himachal government which provides an interface for the user to
upload an image alert of the forest fire. 
\item This then circulate the GPS location of the sender  to the registered authorities like fire brigades, government officials and reporters. 
\item This reduces the time to spot the location and prevent deaths of village people around the active forest fire region. 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Euler Notes}{$2^{nd}$ year Topcoder Hackathon}{}{}
\item A web application indented for hearing impaired people. 
\item The app processes the real-time speech data into text and produces short summaries of the whole speech lecture with the use of machine learning (used extensions). 
\item It identifies main keywords and produces educational links in the same interface.
\end{rSubsection}
