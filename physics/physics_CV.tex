\header{PROJECTS}
\textbf{Path Integrals and Collapse Models: }\\
For my summer research internship at TIFR (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai), I worked under the guidance of Dr. Tejinder Pal Singh (Senior Prof. - Dept. Of Astronomy and Astrophysics), leading a group of 5 students from various IITs. As part of the project, I had the opportunity to formulate path integral approach for some of the collapse models (mainly GRW, QMUPL and CSL models) of quantum measurement problems. While working on the formulation, I was able to find new approaches for the above stated problem (which was conventionally done by comparing the noise function and the imaginary potential in the action for the propagator) by the proper application of jump operators in every infinitesimal time interval, with appropriate probabilities (Poisson process) and also by calculating the final density matrix function(since the probabilistic model involved mixed states). We challenged the idea that the classical limit of quantum mechanics is not just planck constant tends to zero, but also some mechanism to kill superpositions (which is the reason why we don’t observe superposition in macroscopic world) which has candidate theory such as collapse models and only then we can recover classical statistical limit like Liouville equation or Hamilton-Jacobi equation. \\

\textbf{Oscillating Potential Lattice: } \\
I am studying for a project that involves calculating energy eigenvalues of the conduction band of a 3-D lattice having phononic model potential between each unit cell and computationally simulating the results taken under the guidance of Dr. Pradeep Kumar ( Asst. Prof - Dept of Physics IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh). \\
\vspace*{2mm}
\textbf{Non-Geodesic Raychaudhuri Equation: }\\
Having always been fascinated by Physics, I’m currently working on an interesting and self-thought out project on formalising the stress vector being applied on cosmological fluid( fluid mechanics in Riemannian and Pseudo Riemannian geometry) and to study the motion of the resultant non-geodesic curves. It also include the formalism of the fracture point of the material, mainly using the B tensor, it’s decomposition and Raychaudhuri equation, for non-geodesic congruences. \\

\header{INTERESTS}
\textbf{High-Energy Particle Physics: }\\
In this field I have good knowledge on the topics till perturbation theory and their parallel in the Feynman path integral formulation. I have adequate insights about particle physics, mainly the Feynman diagram, different interactions and their associated particles and calculations of invariant amplitude (electron-positron scattering and electron-meson interaction). Going forward, I am further planning to deep dive into quantum field theory. \\
\vspace*{2mm}
\textbf{General Relativity: } \\
I have a good know- why of topics on black holes and their basic mathematics (hypersurfaces, spatial geometry of black holes and their embeddings in 3-dimension, geodesic congruences, energy conditions, horizons, gravitational lensing, and some part of optical general relativity in reference to schwarzschild black holes) have been covered in detail. I am currently pursuing various topics related to conformal mapping and conformal diagrams of spacetime and their application in strong gravitational fields (black holes spacetime). \\
\vspace*{2mm}
\textbf{Cosmology: }\\
Currently I am involved in understanding cosmological and nonlinear fluids in Riemannian geometry, their geodesic congruences and connection with the energy conditions using Einstein field equations. I am also interested in the study of various universe models, their global topology and corresponding spacetime geometries (mainly Robertson-Walker universe). While studying the topic on Einstein field equations, I came across a problem related to the opening of wormhole in outer space. My analysis of the solution revolved around the concept of  negative energy and that the geodesics of wormhole are in complete disagreement with the Raychaudhuri equation. \\
\vspace*{2mm}
\textbf{Abstract Mathematics: }\\
My focus areas in this field includes topology, abstract algebra, algebraic geometry, manifold calculus, tensor calculus, differential geometry, commutative and non-commutative geometry, stochastic processes and stochastic calculus. \\
\vspace*{2mm}
\textbf{Computational Physics: }\\
In this domain I have a good grasp on subjects like finite difference method to solve for velocity field potential, simulations on cosmological fluids, black holes and quantum systems(Einstein’s Toolkit). \\
